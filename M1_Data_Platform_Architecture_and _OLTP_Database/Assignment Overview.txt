This video will give you an overview of the
exercises you need to perform for the transactional database system. In this module, you will perform three exercises
with multiple tasks. But before proceeding with the assignment,
you will check the lab environment by starting the MySQL server. The first exercise requires you to design
the schema for the OLTP database by storing data like product ID,
customer ID, price, quantity, and timestamp of sales in a sales database. In the second exercise, you will load this
data into the OLTP database by importing the data from the downloaded CSV file into the
data table using phpMyAdmin. Further, you will list the tables in the database. And you will also write a query to find out
the count of records in the tables. In the third and final exercise, you will
set up admin tasks by creating an index on the timestamp field and then listing the indexes
on the table. Finally, you will write a bash script that
exports all the rows in the data table to a SQL file. After performing each task, you will take
a screenshot of the command used and the output obtained and give a name to the screenshot. Good luck, and letâ€™s get started!
