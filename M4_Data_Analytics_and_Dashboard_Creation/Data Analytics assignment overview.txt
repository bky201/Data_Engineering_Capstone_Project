This video will give you an overview
of the Data Analytics module. In this assignment, you will perform a
couple of exercises with multiple tasks. But before proceeding with the assignment,
you will check the lab environment by ensuring that you have access to a cloud instance
of the IBM Db2 database and IBM Cognos Analytics. After you have access to
the cloud instance of both, you will download the data from the link provided. The first exercise requires you to
load data into the data warehouse. You will first import data from the
downloaded CSV file into a table and then list the first ten rows in the table. In the second exercise, you will create a data source in Cognos that points
to the table in your IBM Db2 database. In the final exercise, you will create a dashboard by performing tasks such as creating a bar chart of
Quarterly sales of mobile phones, a pie chart of category-wise
sales of electronic goods, and a line chart of month-wise
total sales for a given year. After performing each task, you will take a screenshot of the command you
used and the output you obtained. You will also give a name to each
screenshot. Good luck and letâ€™s get started!
