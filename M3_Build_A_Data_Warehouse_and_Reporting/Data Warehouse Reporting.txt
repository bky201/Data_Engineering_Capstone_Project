This video will give you an overview of the Data Warehouse Reporting lesson of
the Build a Data Warehouse module. In this assignment, you will
perform a couple of exercises. But before proceeding with
the assignment, you will create an instance of IBM Db2 on the cloud by following the instructions
given in the link provided. If you have already created a
Db2 instance in previous courses, you can continue using that
to perform the exercises, but you may need to clean up old tables in case
your database instance is running low on space. The first exercise requires
you to load the data provided by the company into the tables in CSV
format by performing a series of tasks. You will start by downloading the
data from the links provided and then load that data into the DimDate table, DimCategory
table, DimCountry table, and fact table FactSales. And after loading the data, you will take a screenshot of the first five rows
in each table and name the screenshot. In the second exercise, you will query the loaded data by creating a grouping sets query, rollup query, and cube query using the columns Orderid, Category, and Price collected. Finally, you will create a
Materialized Query Table or MQT named Total_sales_per_country using the
country and total sales columns. After performing each task, you will take a screenshot of the SQL
and the output rows and then name the screenshot. Good luck, and letâ€™s get started!
