This video will give you an overview
of querying data in NoSQL databases. This video will give you an overview
of the assignment. In this assignment, you will perform a series of tasks in a
single exercise. But before proceeding with the assignment, you will install
'mongoimport' and 'mongoexport' in the lab environment and then download the
JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) file. The exercise requires you to first import the JSON
file to a MongoDB server database and collection (electronics), and then list out all the databases
and the collections in the database catalog. Next, you will list the first
five documents in the collection, and then you will write a query to find the
count of laptops, the number of smartphones with a screen size of six inches, and
the average screen size of smartphones. Finally, you will export the ID, type, and model fields from the collection into
a comma separated values (or CSV) file. After performing each task, you
will take a screenshot of the command used and the output obtained
and give a name to the screenshot.
