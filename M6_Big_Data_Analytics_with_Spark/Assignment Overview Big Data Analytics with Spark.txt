Welcome again to an overview of the Big Data Analytics
with Spark In this assignment, you will perform a number
of tasks to analyze search terms on the e-commerce web server. You will work in Watson Studio within a Jupyter
notebook to run your analysis against a CSV file containing the webserver data. You will load this file into a Spark data
frame and print the results of your queries against this data set. You will then load a pretrained sales forecasting
model and use this to predict the sales for next year. After performing each task, take a screenshot
of the code you used and its output and name the screenshot. Good luck and letâ€™s get started!
